# Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs

This repository provides a guide on how to reproduce the results demonstrated in the following paper:

Junwei Zang, and Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei, 
"Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs", 
IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

In particular, we provide detailed steps of how to implement the following proposed functions in FDPS:

1. FD simultaneous broadcast and sensing, which is realised by an adaptive FD energy-based collision detection and avoidance algorithm.
2. Internal collision resolution module (i.e. FCFS algorithm).
3. Resource allocation and reservation module.
4. External collision resolution module (i.e. prioritised re-broadcast and scheduling).
5. Average PDR/Latency/Collision Duration performance analyser module.
