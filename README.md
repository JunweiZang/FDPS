# Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs

This repository provides a guide on how the customised simulation platform works, and how to reproduce the results demonstrated in the following paper:

Junwei Zang, and Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei, 
"Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs", 
IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

In particular, we explain how the following proposed functions are implemented:

1. FD simultaneous broadcast and sensing algorithm
2. Average PDR performance analyser module
3. Average latency performance analyser module
4. Average collision duration analyser module
5. The proposed FDPS protocol:
    (1) adaptive collision detection and avoidance algorithm
    (2) resource management and reservation module
    (3) transmission scheduling module
    (4) prioritised re-broadcast and scheduling module
    (5) internal and external collision resolution algorithms
