# Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs

This repository provides a guide on how to reproduce the results demonstrated in the following paper:

Junwei Zang, and Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei, 
"Full Duplex Multiple Access Mechanism for Connected Vehicles Operating at Different Automation Levels in NR eV2X VANETs", 
IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

In particular, we provide detailed steps of how to implement the following proposed functions in FDPS:

1. FD simultaneous broadcast and sensing, which is realised by deploying an adaptive FD energy-based collision detection and avoidance algorithm.
2. Average PDR/Latency/Collision Duration performance analyser modules.
3. Resource management and reservation module.
4. Transmission scheduling module.
5. Prioritised re-broadcast and scheduling module.
